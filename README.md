# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-and-Vizualization

Brief summary: <br>
This folder contains code and data files for testing and analyzing Cryptocurrencies. The specific technique considered describe that which factors have effect on the cryptocurrency price and vizualize the results in graphs, and plots. I have found the correlation between the Bitcoin Price and other factors like BTC price, BTC hash rate, BTC_difficulty etc.

Source Code Organization: <br>
    Cryptocurrency_Analysis.ipynb - This Python file has the necessary code for automatically analyzing the Cryptocurrenties and the factors that have effect on Bitcoin.

top_coins.csv/: Information of top Cryptocureencies

bitcoin_dataset.csv/: Bitcoin information

bitcoin_price.csv/: Bitcoin price

input/: Information of other specific cryptocurrencies to analyze the factors that have effets of the price

version_requirements.txt/: Verrsions of python packages required to run the code.

I have developped the code in google colab. Here, the following picture gives an overview of my code that how I have organised everthing in eight different steps.
